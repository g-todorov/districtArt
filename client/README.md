# districtArt client-side

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) version 0.14.0.
However, the only generator command used is `yo angular` in order to help with the initial project setup.
Due to differences with the file structure created by the other generators all the controllers, services and views are done manually.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
